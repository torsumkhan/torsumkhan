I'm a passionate software developer from Toronto, Canada. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Javascript, APIs. I recently graduated from from [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en) Web Development Bootcamp and created a full stack web app for my final project 👉 [capture](https://github.com/torsumkhan/capsule-social-media-app). I have a professional background in working in the non-profit sector, but my interest in the React ecosystem led me to tranistion into the tech industry.
